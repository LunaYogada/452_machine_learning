# Cluster and classification

## Cluster
Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.

Data Scientist use cluster analysis to gain some valuable insights from our data by seeing what groups the data points fall into. There are five most popular algorithms listed as followed with sample project below:

* **K-means**

  Select a number of classes and randomly initialize their respective center points. Compute the distance between each point and each group center to classify the group with closest center to it. Based on these classified points, recompute the group center by taking the mean of all the vectors in the group. 
  
  Example: [Classify tips dataset with Kmeans](https://github.com/LunaYogada/452_machine_learning/blob/master/cluster%20and%20classfication/Classify%20tips%20dataset%20with%20Kmeans.ipynb)




* **Mean-Shift Clustering**
* **Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)**
* **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
* **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**
