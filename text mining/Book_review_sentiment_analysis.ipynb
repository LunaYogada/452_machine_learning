Based on accuracy score, we can see that Unigram TF Model has the highest accuracy score, which is 87.268%, so this model is the best one for sentiment analysis."

    "From this execise I learned how to preprocess text data and make them into feature matrix, also I learned that feature hashing is useful for magnanimous text data and save storage space. Since this data has labels so I just use machine learning method to train data with sentiment labels instead of sentiment analysis directly. If I have time in the future, I will definitely to try it and compare with this method."
